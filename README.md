# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. The purpose is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Summary

After reviewing all of the samples, we recommend the Easy Ensemble Classifier to run the credit risk analysis. The algorithm yielded the highest balanced accuracy at 92%. Given the sensitive nature of assessing risk for lenders, we want the model that yields the most accurate results.
